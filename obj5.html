							<p>This video encapsulates the essence of this project. The introduction of CBDCs essentially eliminates the elements of anonimity that cash hold, which is the privacy within transactions and the integrity that you can use a dollar as legal tender whereever and whenever. While the integrity of central authorities is questionable as the government has been compromised many times in the past. </p>
							<p>You learned about how the Information Age aims to solve many of the worlds issues through means of data and connecting to the Digital Grid. You learned what a CBDC is and maybe thought it is similar to the already existing cryptocurrency. You learned how traditional cryptocurrencies are decentralized and how that works. You may think that since CBDCs said to be on the blockchain, that means that it is a cryptocurrency, which means that it is decentralized, which means that it is like Bitcoin. This is untrue. As Bitcoin's network acts like a decentralized ledger, each and every CBDC introduced by a country is tied into its respective central bank, so in turn makes does not make this decentralized and makes this ledger more like a database. </p>
							<p>The Central Bank Digital Currency is only one of the many different technologies that allows for more of a centralization of information by the government, the introduction of this technology in conjunction with smart cities, e-government, and Digital IDs, there is a serious shift in power from citizens to the state that has consequences to the state of democracy. </p>
